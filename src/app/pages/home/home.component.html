        <h3>Why we need a blockchain?</h3><br>
        <p>Well, the members of a some business network transact with each other, but they maintain separate records of their transactions. And the thigs they are transacting must have their provenance estavlished each time they're sold to ensure that he business selling an item possesses a chain of title verifying their ownership of it. Modern technology has taken this process from stone tablets and paper folders to hard drives and cloud platforms, but underlying structure is the same, you need days to clear securities transactions, contracts must be signed and executed manually and every database in the system contains unique information.</p>
        <p>However, with blockchain technology we have ability to coordinate their business network through a cost and risk ssociated with private information and processing while improving trust and visibility.</p>
