    <h3>Why we need a blockchain?</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Well, the members of some business network transact with each other, but
      they maintain separate records of their transactions. And the things they
      are transacting must have their provenance established each time they're
      sold to ensure that the business selling an item possesses a chain of
      title verifying their ownership of it. Modern technology has taken this
      process from stone tablets and paper folders to hard drives and cloud
      platforms, but the underlying structure is the same, you need days to
      clear securities transactions, contracts must be signed and executed
      manually and every database in the system contains unique information.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, with blockchain technology we can coordinate their business
      network through a cost and risk associated with private information and
      processing while improving trust and visibility.
